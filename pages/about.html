        Many hackers around the world are (re-)decentralizing the net. This is our part, offering distributed,
        free (as in freedom) services to the world. Always based on <strong>Free Open Source Software</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that building, owning and controlling technology is important. Hackers and Open Source communities
        have an opportunity and a responsibility to offer an alternative, to offer services and tools that people can trust.
        Beyond corporate control, that comes with tracking and data farming. <strong>Decentralized</strong> services and tools that respect users <strong>privacy by default</strong>.
