About a year ago we switched to [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/libreops) for managing donations and expenses. This gave us more funding capabilities and more transparency on how we use our budget.

So this is a good opportunity to do a brief summary of our 2020 budget, how and where we spend our financial resources.

### Expenses

- Mastodon ([libretooh.gr](https://libretooth.gr/)): 121€
- Encrypted DNS ([LibreDNS](https://libredns.gr/)) DNS: 83€
- Legacy DNS ([RadicalDNS](https://libreops.cc/radicaldns.html)): 30€
- Diaspora: 24€
- Jabber ([gnu.gr](https://gnu.gr/)): 24€
- Swag: 17€
- Main website: 13€
- Backup: 5€

**Total: 334€**

### Income

All of our income comes from donations and our own contributions.

**Total: 955€**

### Future plans

Our current surplus gives us the opportunity to plan and deploy new services. Stay tuned! We are always open for ideas and feedback at [our Matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#libreops:matrix.org).
