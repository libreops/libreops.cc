For those new on [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), it's a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet, but also circumventing censorship. For a more detailed overview check the video at the end of the post.

In early February we started experimenting with running a Tor Relay. We chose to do that in a Greek IP address, to contribute to Tor's network diversity. At the momemnt there were only 40 Tor Relays running from Greece.

Almost a month later our relay has already generate 3.2TB of traffic. You can see some graphs below, and on [Tor Metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/E8D114B3C78D8E6E7FEB1004650DD632C2143C9E) website.

We are really happy to contribute on Tor, and hopefully we will run more relays in the future. **If you want to help us run more relays, you can [donate](https://liberapay.com/libreops/donate).**
